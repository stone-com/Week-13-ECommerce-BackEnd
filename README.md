## Technologies used

## How to use

1. Clone or fork this repository to your local machine. 
2. In the root directory, type  'npm i' to download the dependencies.
3.  Initiate the database with 'mysql -u root -p', then 'source db/schema.sql'.
4. Exit the mysql terminal and from bash or zsh, type 'npm run seed' to seed the data into your tables.
5. Type npm start to run the server.
